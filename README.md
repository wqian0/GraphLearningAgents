# GraphLearningAgents

A project that investigates how humans learn network representations of abstract concepts. This work seeks to "optimize" network structures presented to human learners so as to maximize
the accuracy of their internally created network representation of a certain concept. The underlying theory being used is drawn from [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00926).
